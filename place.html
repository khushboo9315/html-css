    <p><span> Mathura Vrindavan </span>is considered to be one of India’s most sacred lands and is filled 
        to the brim with people seeking spiritual enlightenment at any point of the year. Located about 150 
        kilometers from Delhi, Mathura is known as Lord Krishna’s birthplace and has many historical and 
        religious sites. One of the most famous tourist places to visit in Mathura is Shri Krishna Janmabhumi,
         as this location is claimed to be the exact place where Lord Krishna was born, and the jail 
         where he was born is now on view for visitors to see. Besides the jail, the Shri Krishna Janmabhumi 
         also has a magnificent temple.<br><br>

        Mathura has a great history that you can only witness by visiting the old-fashioned architecture,
         the decaying remains of old houses, and the fantastic sociability of the locals who are always 
         willing to show you around.<br><br>We barely had four days to explore Mathura. 
         And like I said, it was inevitable that we wouldn’t be able to cover everything.<br>

        <p1>The Bankey Bihari temple, Vrindavan is amongst the holiest and famous temples of Krishna in India. 
            Shri Swami haridas got Bankey bihari ji appeared in Nidhivan. The idol of Thakur Ji is much older 
            and was worshipped in Nidhivan till 1863. This temple was constructed in 1864 with the contribution 
            of Goswamis. After constructing of temple, Goswamis transferred the idol to this temple. Bankey means 
            “Bent at three places” and Bihari means “Supreme enjoyer”. Bankey bihari ji is worshiped and looked 
            after as a child. There is a different and unique style of celebrating every festival in Bankey bihari 
            temple. The deity is dressed up and offered cuisine (bhog, prasad) according to season. 
            Temple is decorated with lights and various types of flower according to festival. 
            There are no bells or conch in the temple because Bankey Bihari does not like the sound of bells or 
            conch. there is only chant of ‘radha naam’. When someone enters in the temple, he feels an eternal 
            bliss and calm and forgets all misery. As soon as someone meets with Thakur ji, he becomes dedicating 
            himself to Thakur ji. Kind hearted Thakur ji demolish 
            his problem and bless him with His divine grace how far he is.</p1>

        <p1><b>Govardhan Mountain: The miracle of Shri Krishna!</b><br><br>
            Govardhan Hill near Mathura is perhaps one of the biggest miracles of Shri Krishna. 
            The story goes that the villagers used to perform a special Puja but Krishna ji asked 
            his father about it. He was against it and he debated with the villagers that they should 
            do their duty and not indulge in sacrifices. The villagers were convinced and did not perform
             the Puja which made Lord Indra extremely angry and immersed the village in floods.
            
            So Shri Krishna as a boy lifted and held the Govardhan Hill or Govardhan Mountain on 
            his index finger and all the natives found shelter under it to be saved from the rage of Indra.
             The floods continued for seven days and seven nights. At last Indra had to accept defeat. 
             People visit the place during Guru Purnima for Govardhan Puja with a 23 km long Parikrama (round).</p1>

        <p1><b>Nandgaon: The land of Baba Nand!</b><br><br>Nandgaon or Nandgram situated stop Nandeshwar 
            Hill approximately 51 North-East of Mathura is believed to be the village established by Nand Baba.
             It is about 48 km from Vrindavan, the place where Krishnaji used to go to play with his cow herder
              friends and 20 km from Barsana, the home town of Radharani and about 65 km away from Gokul, their
               original village.

            It happened that at the instigation of the maternal uncle of Shri Krishna, Kansa, the evil 
            activities of the Rakshas had increased in Gokul. This prompted Nand Baba to think about shifting
             to another place to save his son little Kanhaiyya and his people. The whole Gokul village then 
             shifted atop the Nandishwar Hill and named their village as Nandgaon.</p1>

             as the most prominent site dedicated to the pastimes of Hindu deities Radha Krishna and 
             their gopis. It is the common belief among devotees that Nidhivan still witnesses the Raslila
              (dance) of Radha and Krishna during night time and thus, nobody is allowed to stay inside the 
              premises of Nidhivan at night.

                        The site has numerous Tulsi (Basil) plants which are short in height but found in pairs 
            and have entangled trunks. Besides Tulsi plants, the premises houses a palace called 
            "Rang Mahal" where it is believed that Radha Krishna spend their night after raslila, 
            a temple called "Bansichor Radha" where Radha has stolen the flute of Krishna, a shrine 
            dedicated to Swami Haridas who with his complete devotion made the idol of Banke Bihari 
            appeared, Raas Leela Sthali where Raslila is performed and Lalita Kund which was believed
             to be made by Krishna himself when gopis asked for water amidst of Raslila.</p1>
